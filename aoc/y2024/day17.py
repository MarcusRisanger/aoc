    Works backward to check for A that satisfies outputs.

    For instance: Let's say the program ends with [...,5,3,0].

    First it will find which value 0-7 that will output [0],
    which is A = 5. This value is multiplied by 8 and stored in the queue
    along with the required next sublength (2) to check against program output.

    For the next index, we find which value 0-7 to add to (5*8) that gives
    output [3,0] - this includes A=42 and A=47. Both of these are added to the
    queue after multiplying by 8. We now have two "seeds" to track backward from.

    We check A=42..49 and A=47..54 for program outputs of [5,3,0] .. etc.

    When we are at the last digit, we will have several values for A that satisfy
    the requirement, so we put all A's into a list and return the smallest value.
